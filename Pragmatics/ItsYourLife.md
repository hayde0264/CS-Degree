# It's Your Life 

It is your life. You own it. You create it. 

Some developers become frustrated. There concerns 
are different, though. 

Some may think they're struggling in their job, 
others think technology has passed them by, some 
feeling underappreciated, underpaid, or that their 
colleagues at work are unhealthy. 

### Change 
Programmers must be near the top of careers in which employees have control. For instance, **our skills are in 
demand, our knowledge crosses geographic boundaries, we can work remotely, and we're paid well**. 

## Tip 3- You Have Agency 
Is your work environment good? Do you like your job? 

**Try to fix it** 

A quote from Martin Fowler is, *"you can change your organization or change your organization"*. 

If technology is passing you by, **allocate time to study new paradigms and languages**. What you 
do off of the clock is up to you. By learning, **you're only increasing your worth**. 

An instance - Say you want to work remotely... Have you asked? If your current job declines such a request, find another company that will.
