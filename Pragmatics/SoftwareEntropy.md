# Software Entropy 

*Entrophy*, which is a term from physics, references the amount of "disorder" within a system. 

### Developer Jargon: 

*Software rot*" - is when disorder increases within your program. 

*Technical debt*- is a more optimistic term that implies that "they'll pay back for it someday", but they probably wont. 

### There are many things that lead to software rot: 
The biggest one seems to be the **psychology or culture** among a work project. 

Despite grand plans and wonderful developers, project's can still rot and decay in their lifetime. Ironically, there are other projects that encompass enormous difficulties and constant setbacks, but successfuly overcome the tendency towards disorder and turn out fine. 

### So what's the point: 
**Psychologist have done studies that reveal hopelessness is contagious**. 

So, instead of getting in the dumps, from creating a bad design, making wrong descision, or writing poor code. *Don't leave the window broken*. **Drop your ego, and fix it as soonas it's discovered**. If there isn't time to install a new window, **board it up like the zombies are coming**. For instance, comment out offending code, or display a "Not Implemented" message, or substitute dummy data instead. The point is, **act fast once you discover a shortcoming this prevents furthur damage**. Because leaving broken windows unfixed, jjust like within a city, instills a sense of carelessness. **So another window gets broken, people start littering, graffati appears**, and within a short period of time **the building becomes damaged beyond the owner's desire to fix it**.
