Entropy, a term from physics, references the amount of "disorder" within a system.


## Developer Jargon:
Software rot" - is when **disorder increases within your program**.

Technical debt- is a more optimistic term that implies that "they'll pay back for it someday," but they probably won't.

## There are many things that lead to software rot:
The biggest one seems to be the **psychology or culture** of a work project.

Despite grand plans and wonderful developers, projects can still rot and decay. Ironically, there are other projects that encompass enormous difficulties and constant setbacks but triumphantly overcome the tendency towards disorder and turn out fine.

## So what's the point:
Psychologists have done studies that reveal **hopelessness is contagious**.

So, instead of getting in the dumps, from creating a bad design, making the wrong decision, or writing poor code. Don't leave the window broken. **Drop your ego, and fix the broken window as soon as it's discovered**. 

## Tip 5 - Don't Live with Broken Windows

If there isn't time to install a new window, **board it up like the zombies are coming**. For instance, comment out offending code, display a "Not Implemented" message, or substitute dummy data instead. The point is to act fast once you discover a shortcoming; **this prevents further damage**. 

Leaving broken windows unfixed instills a sense of carelessness. So another window gets broken, people start littering, graffiti appears, and within a short period of time, the building **becomes damaged beyond the owner's desire to fix it**.
