# The Cat Ate My Source Code 

One of the main pragmatic philosophies is learning to take responsibility for your shortcomings. 

Pragmatic programmers **take charge of their 
own career, and aren't afraid to admit ignorance 
or error**. 

We all make mistakes, but it's important to note 
those around you rely on or you; and you should be 
able to rely on them. In a healthy environment 
based on trust, you should safely speak your mind 
and present your ideas, **and rely on team members 
who can, in turn, rely on you**. 

## Take Responsibility 
Responsibility is something you actively agree to. 

When you accept the responsibility for an outcome, **you should expect to be held accountable for it**. 

Don't blame someone or something else or make an excuse. 
Instead, **provide solutions not excuses**. 

## Challenge yourself to: 
Instead of saying, "I don't know," and ending your sentence there. Say, "I don't know, **but I will find out**."
