# Version Control

Version control is known as a system that keeps track of changes to a file or to a set of files over time. 


## Version Control Allows Developers To: 
- **revert files or projects to previous states** 
- **compare file changes over time** 
- **view who have modified files** 
- **and introduce issues**
