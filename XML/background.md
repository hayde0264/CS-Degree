XML is a markup language and file format for **storing, transmitting, and reconstructing data**. 

The difference between HTML and XML is that HTML was designed to **display data**, but XML was designed to **carry data**. Another major difference is that XML allows you to design tags specifically for certain needs. Thus creating a powerful way to store data in a format that can be **stored, searched, and shared**.
