XML is a markup language and file format for **storing, transmitting, and reconstructing data**. 

The difference between HTML and XML is that HTML was designed to **display data**, but XML was designed to **carry data**. Another major difference is that XML allows you to design tags specifically for certain needs. Thus creating a powerful way to store data in a format that can be **stored, searched, and shared**.

## Business applications of XML? 
XML, as mentioned above, **transfers data among databases and Web sites without losing crucial descriptive information**. 

XML lets you **automatically** customize the presentation of data rather than **display the same page to all corners**. Thus, making **searches more efficient because search engines can sort through precise tags rather than long pages of text**. 

For instance, when a company sells a good or service to another company, a great deal of information is exchanged - prices, terms, specifications, delivery schedules, and so on. **HTML's one-size-fits-all nature** makes such exchanges difficult, but with XML, all the necessary information can be **shared efficiently**."
