 # How does a while loop work?

 A while loop is a block of code that is executed **repeatedly until a certain condition is met** (until the expression is false).

 Remember, the expression **must be a boolean**.

 ```java
 while (expression)
    loop_body
 ```

 ## The process:
 1. The expression is evaluated. If true, the loop is executed again. If false, terminate.
 2. Repeat 1 until expression == false
