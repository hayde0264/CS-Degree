# Control flow 

Control flow is the process 
of analysing variables within 
a system and then chooseing 
which one(s) to execute based 
on given parameters. 

## How does it work? 
Initial conditions are declared 
to the compiler. These "preconditions" 
are the state of variables before entering 
a control structrues. Based on those 
preconditions, the compiler runs an 
algorithm (the control structure) to 
determine the output. 

## Types of flow control: 
- *Sequential*  
- *Selection* 
- *Repitition*

## Seqential Flow 
used for iteration through each element within a collection. 

### Examples of sequential flow: 
- for 





## Selection Flow 
used for making decisions based on conditions (true or false). 

## Examples of selection flow: 
- if 
- if/else 
- switch 
- when  




## Repitition Flow 
used for looping, which means, repeating a a piece of 
**until a certain condition is met**. 

### Exmaples of repition flow:
- while 
- do/while
