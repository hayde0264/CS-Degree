# Switch 

The **switch** statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a "case." 

The switch statement can be **implemented instead of redundant if/else statements** to increase code readability. 

## How does it work? 
1. The switch expression is evaluated once 
2. The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case 
3. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
4. The break statement breaks out of the switch block and stops the execution 
5. The default statement specifies code to execute if there are no matches
