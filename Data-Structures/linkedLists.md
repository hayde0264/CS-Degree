# Linked Lists

A *linked list* is a data strucuture that represents a sequence 
of nodes. 

## How are linked lists implemented?
- Within a singly linked list, each node points to the next 
  node within the particular list.  
- In doubly linked lists, each node points to the next AND 
  previous node within a particular collection. 

### It's import to remember that unlike arrays, a linked list does not provide a constant "lookup time". 

### When is a good time to use a linked list? 
A great time to use a linked list is when you need to **add** or **remove** elements frequently. 
This operation is done is constant time.
