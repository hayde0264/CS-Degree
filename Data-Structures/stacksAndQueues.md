# Stacks & Queues

*Stacks* are data structures that use **LIFO** 
(last-in first-out) ordering. As example is, dinner 
plates at a buffet bar. 

## Stacks use the following methods 
- *pop()*: will remove the top item from the stack 
- *push(element)*: will add the element to the top of the stack 
- *peek()*: will return the top element of the stack 
- *isEmpty()*: will only return true if the stack is empty

## When is a good time to use a Stack? 
Stacks are often useful is certain recursive algorithms. 
Sometimes you will need to push data onto a stack as 
you implement recursion, but then remove such element 
as you backtrack. 

*Queues* are data structures that use **FIFO** 
(first-in first-out) ordering. As example is, customers 
in the grocery store line. 

## Queues use the following methods 
- *add(element)*: will add an item to the end of the list
- *remove()*: will remove the first item in the list 
- *peek()*: will return the top of the queue
- *isEmpty()*: will only return true if the stack is empty
