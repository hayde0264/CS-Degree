# Relational Databases 

Relational databases **organize data among rows and columns** which collectively form a table.

These "tables" create **relations** which are the **logical connections between different tables**. 

## Why use Relational Databases: 
- They're **flexible** because you easily create, update, or delete data 
- They have **ACID compliance** which stands for (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) data validity
- They're **easy to use** with knowledge of queries 
- Multiple people can **collaborate** through operating on and accessing data simulantaneously
- They come with **built-in security** when limites access to specified users 
- They're designed with **normalization** which is a design that reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity
