# Git add
The *git add* command adds changes within your working directory 
to the "staging area". This command tests git, "I want you to add 
certain files before my next commit". The git add command should 
be called each time you alter a file. 

## How do you use git add? 
Git add is connected with *git commit*. These commands update versions 
of the specific project history. The git add command should be called 
every time a file is created or changed. This command sends files to the 
"git staging area". Only after you've added files, can you use git commit 
to update your project history. 

## It's a two-step process where each action has equal importance:
1. First - git add 
2. Second - git commit 

### As mentioned above, git add stages changes for the next commit 

## Usage 
- git add <file> 
- git add --all
