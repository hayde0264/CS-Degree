# Software Version Control 
## Why is version control important? 
- You can combine the work of multiple collaborators 
- Understand changes in software 
- Support incremental development 
- Compare and revert to earlier solutions 
- Backup 
- Parallel versions 
- Document Development

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) whose 
primary interface is through the command line. Git allows 
you to save changes within your local repositories to online 
storages such as GitHub.
