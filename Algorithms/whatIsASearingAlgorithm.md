# What is a searching algorithm? 

*Searching algorithms* are used to **search** or 
**search and return** an element from a data structure. 

## The two types of searching algorithms are: 
**Sequential search** - which iterates through **EACH** element 
		        consecutively, and will return if the 
			key is found. (ex. Linear Search) 
**Interval search** - which search for elements by dividing the 
		      searching space in half, thus creating a 
		      much more efficient algorithm. (ex. Binary Search)
