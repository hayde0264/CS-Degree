# Recursion 

*Recursive algorithms* take problems and break them into smaller 
"sub problems". 


## Approaches 
*Bottom-Up Approach* - means we understand how to solve the problem for a 
		       simple case, like a list with only 1 element. Then 
		       we figure out how to solve the problem for two elements, 
		       then for three elemenet, ets.*Think about how you can 
		       build the solutuion for one case based on the previous 
		       one*. 

*Top-Down Approach* - means to think about how we can DIVIDE can (n) into 
		      subproblems. 

*Half-and-Half Approach* - references try to DIVIDE the data set in half. An 
			   example is binary search.
