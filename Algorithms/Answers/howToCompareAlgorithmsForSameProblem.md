# How do you compare two algorithms written for the same problem? 

The *complexity of an algoritm* is a used to describe how efficient an
alogrithm is. It evalutates how the size of the particular data set will 
affect execution time. 

## Algorithms are categorized according to how much time or space they take up 

### There are two units of measure: 
*Complexity of time* - which computes the **running time** of a program 

*Complexity of space* - which examies algorithms based on how much space 
		        they require to complete their tasks.
