# How can you compare the efficiency of algorithms? 

To figure out the efficiency of an algorithm, we must consider the **RAM** model of computation and the **analysis of worst-case complexity**. 
These metrics are measured by **"big Oh"** notation, which compares algorithms and helps in designing more efficient ones.
