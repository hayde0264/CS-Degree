## What is a brute force algorithm? 


A brute force algorithm is the most simple type of algorithm. For instance, when using a brute force approach, you 
iterate every possibility to solve that problem. Since the time complexity of a brute force algorithm is congruent with its input size, brute force algorithms are often very slow.
