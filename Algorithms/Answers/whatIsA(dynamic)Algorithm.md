# What is a dynamic algorithm? 


A dynamic algorithm stores previously calculated results to avoid calculating again and again. When using dynamic programming, you divide a complex problem into smaller subproblems and store results for future use. 


## Famous examples: 
- **Knapsack Problem** 
- **Weighted Job Scheduling** 
- **Floyd Warshall Algorithm**
