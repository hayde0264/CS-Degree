# What is a greedy algorithm? 

A *greedy algorithm* references an algorithm 
that is designed to choose optimal choices 
at each sub-step, thus rendering a globally 
solution. 

## Greedy Algorithms select the best immediate option 

### Algorithms that implement
- Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm 
- Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm 
- Travelling Salesman Problem 
- Fractional Knapsack Problem 
- Dijkstra's Algorithm 
- Job Scheduling Problem 
- Graph Max Coloring 
- Graph Vertex Cover
