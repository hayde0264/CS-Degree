# What is Dynamic Programming 

*Dynamic programming* is a paradigm that suggests 
**to save the results of subproblems** so you do 
not have to recalculate them at a later time. 

## Dynamic Programming in concerned with recursion optimization 

### Algorithms that implement: 
- Finding the (n)th Fibonacci number 
- Finding the long common subsequence between two strings 
- Finding the longest palindromic substring in a string 
- the discrete Knapsack problem 
- Shortest pack between any two nodes in a graph
