# Selection sort 

**Time** - O(n^2) 
**Space** - O(1) 

*Selection sort* finds the smallestt element using 
a linear scan and then will move it to the front. 
Then will find the second smallest and move it; doing 
so again with a lnear scan. Completing this process until 
all of the elements have been iterated.
