# Binary Search

Class: **Search**

**BEST** - O(1) 

**WORST** - O(log N) 

**COMPLEXITY** - O(1) for iterative, O(log N) for recursive

*Binary Search* begins by comparing an element in the middle 
of an array with the target (key) value. If the target value 
matches the element, its position with the array is returned. 
If the target value is **less than** the element, the search 
continues in the **lower half** of the array. If the target value 
is **greater tha** the element, the search continues in the **upper 
half** of the array.
