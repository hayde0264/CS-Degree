# Amortized Time 
 
**Amortized analysis** - is the worst-case analysis of a **sequence of operations**.

Amortized analysis is used for algorithms where an occasional operation is **very slow**. The general idea is to limit **worse case scenarios**, thus **amortizing the cost**. 


## Data structures implementing Amortized Analysis: 
- Hash Tables 
- Disjoint Sets 
- Splay Trees
