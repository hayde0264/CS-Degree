# Recursion 

*Recursive algorithms* break problems into subproblems. Subproblems 
are generally referred to in two manners: the bottom-up approach, 
or the top-down approach. 

**Bottom-Up approach** - is usually the most intuitive. In the bottom-up 
		       approach **you start with knowing how to solve the 
		       problem for a simple case**. Next, **you figure out
		       how to solve the problem for two, three, four, etc. 
		       elements**. 

**Top-Down approach** - is less concerte than the bottom-up approach. In the 
			top-down approach **you think about how you can divide 
			the problem for case (n) into subproblems**. This often 
			comes in the forth of dividing the data set in half.
