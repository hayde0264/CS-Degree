# Big O 

*Big O* time is the language and metric used to describe 
the efficency of algorithms. 

## Classifying algorithms by performance (from fastest to slowest): 
- **Constant Functions** *where f(n) = 1* (ex. a function that adds two numbers and prints the result)
- **Logarithmic Functions** *where f(n) = log n* (ex. some functions grow quite slowly as *n* increases, but faster than a constant function) 
- **Linear Functions** *where f(n) = n* (ex. iterating through an entire collection one by one). 
- **Sublinear Functions** *where f(n) = n lg n* (ex. a good example is **Quick** and **Merge** sort, they only grow a smidge faster than linear functions)
- **Quadratic Functions** *where f(n) = n ^ 2* (ex. quadratic functions that read pairs of items. Popular quadratic functions are **Insertion** and **Selection** sort) 
- **Cubic Functions** *where f(n) = n ^ 3* (ex. functions that enumerate tripes of items) 


## What is Space Complexity in Big O? 
*Space complexity* references the amount of memory 
required by a particular algorithm.
