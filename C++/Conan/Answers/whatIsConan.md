# What is Conan? 

Conan is a dependency and package manager for the C and C++ languages. 

## Conan: 
- **is free and open-source** 
- **works on all platforms** 
- **can integrate with systems such as CMake, or Visual Studio** 

## Decentralized Package Manager 
Conan is a **decentralized** package manager that supports a **client-server** architecture. Which means clients 
can fetch packages, as well as upload packages, to different servers (similar to git pull/push to git remotes). 

## Binary Management
Conan can create and manage **pre-compiled** binaries, thus avoiding repeated builds from the source, which ultimately saves 
time for developers as well as integration servers.
