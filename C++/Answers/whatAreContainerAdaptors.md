# What are container adaptors? 

In C++, **stacks, queues, and priority_queues** are considered **container adaptors**. Container adaptors are **not full container classes**; instead, 
these classes provide specific interfaces that rely on **objects of the container classes (like deque or list)** to handle its elements. This 
creates encapsulation since elements are **accessed by the container adaptor** rather than the underlying **container class used**.
