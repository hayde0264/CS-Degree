# What is the point of a typedef? 

Typedefs in C++ **create synonyms for existing types**. 

## They're used when: 
- **you'd like to hide the implementation of a given type and instead emphasize the prupose** 
- **to streamline complex type definitions** 
- **to allow single types to be used for more than one purpose** 

## For instance:
