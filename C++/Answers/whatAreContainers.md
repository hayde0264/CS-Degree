In C++, a container is a header that stores **a collection of elements**. Containers are **implemented as class templates**, thus 
creating greater flexibility among **element types**. 

## How do you use them? 
Containers manage storage space for their elements as well as **provide member functions to access them**, either 
directly or through iterators (such as pointers). 

## Common instances include: 
- **vectors (dynamic arrays)** 
- **queues** 
- **stacks** 
- **heaps (priority queues)** 
- **lists (linked lists)** 
- **trees (sets)** 
- **associate arrays (maps)**

## Which one should you pick? 
Since most containers have similar member functions, the decision of which container to use 
doesn't depend on functionality, but rather **efficiency of its members (complexity)**. For instance, 
within sequence containers, different containers are faster/slower at inserting or removing elements than others.
