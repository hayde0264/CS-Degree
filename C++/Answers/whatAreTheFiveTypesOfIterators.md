# What are the five types of iterators? 

1. Input - *read, but not write; increment only*
2. Output - *write, but not read; increment only*
3. Forward - *read and write; increment only* 
4. Bidirectional - *read and write; increment and decrement* 
5. Random Access - *read and write; full iterator arithmetic*
