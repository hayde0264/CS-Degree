# What is the input iterator? 

**input iterator** - can read elements of a container but is not allowed to write into a container. 


## Input Iterators must provide: 
- Equality and inequality operators (==, !=) to compare iterators 
- Prefix and postfix increment (++) to advance iterators 
- Dereference operators to read elements 
- The arrow operator (->) as a synonym for *it.member
