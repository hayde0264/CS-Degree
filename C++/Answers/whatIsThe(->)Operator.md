# What is the -> operator? 

The **(->)** operator is called the **" member access operator**. Using this operation eliminates the need for **parenthesis** and 
the **dereferncing operator**. 


## For instance: 
```cpp 
(*somePtr).name = "hayden"; // verbose 
somePtr->name = "hayden"; // preferred 
```
