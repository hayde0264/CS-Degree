 # What is the insertion operator? 
  
 The insertion operator (<<), which is two "less than signs," when used with **cout**, the insetion operator formats **output operations**. 
  
 ## For example: 
 ```cpp 
 cout << "This is an example of an output sequence using the insertion operator. \n";
 int a = 4;           
 cout << "The number you chose is " << a << " . \n"; 
 
 
 // Outputs         
 * This is an example of an output sequence using the insertion operator. 
 * The number you chose is 4. 
 ```
