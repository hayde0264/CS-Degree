# What are pointers in Go? 

In Golang pointers are variables that hold addresses of 
values. They are sometimes called **special variables**. 

## Pointers have two operators, they are: 
1. The * operator which is called the **dereferencing operator** is used to access values 
2. The & operator is called the **address operator** it's responsible for returning the addrss of variables stored in the pointer
