Control flow allows programmers to make decisions based on the values of variables and constants.

Boolean values are the **cornerstone of control flow**.  

## Go constructs for making decisions: 
- if/else statements 
- Switch statments 

## If/Else 
An if/else statement basically says, **"do x if such-and-such is true; otherwise, do y."**
