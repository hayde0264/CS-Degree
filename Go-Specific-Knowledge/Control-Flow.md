# Control Flow 

## Go contains the following control operators: 
- if/else 
- switch 
- for 
- defer 

## If/Else 
If/Else blocks work on a "true/false" based concept. 

*If* the initial condition is true execute...  

*Else if* the first condition was false, and if this block is true execute... 

*Else* the first and second conditions were false, execute default block... 




## Switch 
Switch statements offer different states depending on certain input. 




## For Loops 
The for loop is intended to iterate through a list within a **specified number of times**. 



## Defer 
The defer statement is used to signify that a block of code should be executed at the end of a function.
