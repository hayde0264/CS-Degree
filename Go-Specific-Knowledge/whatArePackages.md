# What are packages in Golang? 

Go packages (or pkg) are simply directories which contain 
Go source files or other Go packages. Each piece of code 
from variables to functions are written in the "source files", 
so they, too, are stored in a package. 

## Declaring Packages

### You may declare a package at the top of a Go file as package<package_name> 

### You may import package(s) at the top of a Go file as import <package_name> 

#### ***An import Go package is the "fmt" package. The "fmt" package has valuable functions such as Prinln().
