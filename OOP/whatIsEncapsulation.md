# What is encapsulation 

*Encapsulation* is the process of combining attributes (data) and methods 
(actions on such data) within the same entity.

Encapsulation provides objects with the bility to hide their 
internal characteristics and behaviors. 

## Why is encapsulation powerful? 
- the internal state of each object is protected
- it increases usability and maintenance of code
- it imporved modularity by preventing objects from 
  interacting with each other, in an undesired way.
