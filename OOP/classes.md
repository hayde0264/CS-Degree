# Classes 

*Classes* are blueprints for objects. 

When you initialize an object, you use a class 
as the "bones" for the objects design. Classes 
are like the template, or house plan, for objects. 

### Classes contain attributes and methods. 

## Attributes are the "data" of the class. It's what you "know". 

## Methods are the "actions" of the class. It's what you "do".
