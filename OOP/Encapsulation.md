# Encapsulation 

Abstraction says, "you're allowed to look at an object at a  **high level of detail**".

Encapsulation says, "you **aren't allowed to look at an object atany other level of detail**. 

Encapsulation is a way of saying that you can look at the outside of the house but you can't get close enough to identify the kitchens details. 

For instance, you're allowed to know there's a garage at the house, but you don't know what's inside of the garage.
