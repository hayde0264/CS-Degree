# Encapsulation 

While abstraction says, "you're allowed to look at an object at a  **high level of detail**."Encapsulation says, "you **aren't allowed to look at an object at any other level of detail**. 

Encapsulation is a way of saying that you can look at the outside of the house, but you can't get close enough to identify the details of the kitchen. 

## In a CS manner, this means: 
Classes know they are among other classes within the system; however, they don't know the attributes of their neighbors.
