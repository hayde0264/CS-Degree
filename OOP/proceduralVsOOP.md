# What is the Difference between OOP and Procedural Programming? 

In *OOP* programming, the attributes and behaviors are contained within 
a SINGLE object. 

In *Procedural or Structural* programming,the attributes and behaviors 
are generally seperated. In structued programming data is often seperated 
from procedures, and sometimes, data is gloabl. this means it is EASY to 
modify data that is outside the scope of your code. However, this also means 
data is UNCONTROLLED and UNPREDICTABLE (because multiple functions may have 
access to the global data). On top of that, since you have no control over 
who has access to the data, testing and debugging are much more difficult. 

## OOP 
- encapsulate data and the operations that manipulate the data within a single object


## Procedural 
- seperates data from the operations that manipulate such data (attributes from methods)
