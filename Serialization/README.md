# Serialization

**Serialization** - converts objects into streams made up of **bytes** so
that objects can be **transmitted into memory, a database, or a file**.

## Serialization occurs when:
- **sending an object to a remote application by using a web service**
- **passing an object from one domain to another**
- **passing an object through a firewall as a JSON or XML string**
- **maintaining security or user-specific information across applications**

## Visually:
