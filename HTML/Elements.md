# Elements 

An HTML element is **eveything inbetween the tags**. 

For instance: 
<tagname>Content</tagname> 

# Nested Elements 
Elements can be nested which means **that elemetns can cotain other elements**. 

Every single HTML document consits of **nested elements**. 

## This example contains 4 elements: 
``` html 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> 
        <body> 
                <h1>A Heading</h1> 
                <p>A Paragraph</p> 
        </body> 
</html> 
``` 
In this example the <html> element is the **root element** so it defines the whole document. 

Notice how it has a start tag **<html>** and an end tag **</html**> 

## Inside of the <html> element ther is a body element: 
 ``` html  
        <body> 
                <h1>A Heading</h1> 
                <p>A Paragraph</p> 
        </body> 
 ``` 

## Inside of the <body> element there are two more elements: 
``` html 
     <h1>A Heading</h1> 
     <p>A Paragraph</p>  
``` 

The <h1> element defines a **heading**. 

The <p> element deinfes a **paragraph**. 

The <br> tag referenes a ling break. 

## For instance: 
``` html 
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break. </p> 
``` 
        
# HTML is not case sensitive 
This means that the paragraph tag <p> can also be noted as <P>. 

Although, it is good practice to use the lowercase p.
