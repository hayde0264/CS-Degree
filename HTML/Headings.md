# Headings 

HTML headings are **titles or subtitles** that you want displayed on your webpage. 

HTML headings are defined from the (**<h1>**) to (**<h6>**) tag (growing smaller as the number increases). 

## For example: 
```html 
<h1>Biggest Heading<h1> 
<h2> heading <h2> 
<h3> heading <h3> 
<h4> heading <h4> 
<h5> heading <h5> 
<h6>Smallest Heading<h6> 
``` 

# Why are headings important? 
Headings are important because search engines **use headings to index the structure and content** of your web pages. Also, users generally will skim a page and choose your page or not **based on the heading**.
