# What is the CPU? 

The central processing unit, often called the **"CPU"** for brevity, performs most of the calculations which enable 
a computer to function, so it's commonly asserted as the **brain of the computer**. 

## What is the CPU responsible for? 
The CPU receives program instructions from random-access memory, interprets such information, and then sends back results so that the computer 
components can proceed with instructions.
