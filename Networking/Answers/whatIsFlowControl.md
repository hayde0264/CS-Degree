 # What is flow control? 
  
 Flow control is a method used that **control the data flow between devices**.
 
 Flow control is managed **from the server to control the rate at which a client can receive data**.
  
 Flow controls are initiated when the client tells the server, "stop sending data; I have nowhere to put it."
