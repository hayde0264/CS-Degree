# Collections 

In programming, a *collection* is a class 
that's used to represent a group of similar 
data as a **single type**. 

Collections **group** and **manage** related objects. 

## What's the point of collections? 
Collections use their underlying data structure 
to **store** and **manipulate** data effectively. 

## Most modern languages break collections into: 
*Lists* - also known as arrays, lists are collections 
          that except duplicate elements and are 
	  accessible through indexing the elements 
          within the list.
 
*Sets* - are collections that **do not** allow 
	 duplicate elements.
 
*Maps* - also known as dictionaries, are collections 
	 that contain key/value pairs. Maps **cannot** 
	 contain duplicate pairs. 

### You may perform the following operations on collections:  
- Searching 
- Deletion 
- Insertion 
- Traversal 
- Sorting 
- Cloning
