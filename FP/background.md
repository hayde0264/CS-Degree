# Functional Programming 

## What are some of the paraidmgs of FP? 
- *Pure Functions* 
- *Recursion* 
- *Transparency*
- *First-Class Functions* 
- *Immutability* 


## FP can be: 
 **Comprehensible** because pure functions don't change states 
 **Concurrent** because pure functions avoid changing variables or data outside of it 
 **Lazyily evaluated** because can be stored and evaluated only when needed 
 **Easier to debug and test** because pure functions take arguements once and produce unchangeable outputs 

## Does FP have any disadvantages? 
1. Potentially pooer performance, because of immutable values and recursive methods. 
2. Writing pure functions isn't always easy 
3. Making programs without any imparative programming paradigms ("if statments", "for loops", "while") can be complicated
