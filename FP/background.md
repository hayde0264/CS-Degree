# Functional Programming 

Functional programming is also known as 
*declarative programming*. Declarative 
programming tells the compiler **what 
we want**, rather than delve into how 
to do it.

Functional programming gives the developer 
an alterative to traditional control-flow 
paradigms. Rather than use if-else or for 
loops, you can use can methods on collections 
such as map, filter, and reduce.  

## What are some of the paraidmgs of FP? 
- *Pure Functions* 
- *Recursion* 
- *Transparency*
- *First-Class Functions* 
- *Immutability* 

## Benefits of FP? 
**Fewer Mutations**  
**Parallelized Code**  
**Expressive Code** 
**Concise Code** 
**Intuitive Code** 
**Avoidance of Side Effects**
