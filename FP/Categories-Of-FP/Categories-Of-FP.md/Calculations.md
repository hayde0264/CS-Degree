# Calculations 

**Calculations** - are computations from input to output. Calculations, when given the 
		   same input, should return the same ouput. 

Calculations can be called from anytime, and anywhere without affecting things outside of their scope. Making them **easy to test and have to use**. 

## Calculations in FP: 
- staticly aid correctness  
- provide mathmatical tools 
- provide testing strategies
