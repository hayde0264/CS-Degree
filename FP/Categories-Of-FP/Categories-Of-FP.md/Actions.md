# Actions 

**Actions** - are anything that depends on **when it's run**, or **how many times it's run**, **or both**. 

For instance, sending an email today is much different from sending it next week; sending the same email five times is different from sending it once. 

## FP aids actions with: 
- safely changing state over time 
- ways to guarantee ordering 
- tools to ensure actions happen exactly once
