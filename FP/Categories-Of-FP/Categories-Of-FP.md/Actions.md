# Actions 

**Actions** - is anything that depends on **when it's run**, or **how many times it's run**, **or both**. 

For instance, sending a email today, is much different from sending it next week. Or, sending the same email 5 times is different from sending it once. 

## FP aids actions with: 
- safely changing state over time 
- ways to garuntee ordering 
- tools to ensure actions happen exactly once
