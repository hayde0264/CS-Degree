# Map

The *map* method goes through each element 
of an array and applies a **passed in** function 
to each element, and finally will return a brand 
new array with modified values. 

### The .map() method is sometimes referenced as "apply-to-all" 
Since the .map() method updates each element 
in an array, if you have a huge collection 
of data, using a for loop may be better. 

## Explained in a sentence: 
The .map() method have the ability to 
change objects within collections by 
applying functions.
