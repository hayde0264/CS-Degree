# Pure Functions 


*Pure functions* always return the same output (if the same arguements
are passed in), and **do not** produce any side-effects. 

## What are side-effects? 
*Side effects* occur when your function interacts outside of its scope. 

### Common example of side-effects are
- Api calls 
- Mutating Data 
- Console logs to the screen 
- Async/Await calls
