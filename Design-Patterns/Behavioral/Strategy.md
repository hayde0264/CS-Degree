# Strategy Pattern 

Class: **Behavioral** 

The *strategy design pattern* is a behavioral software design pattern 
that enables the programmer **to select an algorithm at runtime**. Rather 
than use a single algorithm directly, objects can receive run-time instructs 
as to which algorihtm to implement. 

## How does it work? 
To adhere to the strategy pattern, behaviors of classes **should not** 
be inhereited. Instead, behaviors should be **encapsulated with interfaces**.
This references that open/closed principal, which states classes **should be 
open for extension but closed for modification**. The strategy pattern uses 
composition (has - a) instead of inheritance (is - a). 

### Steps 
- Seperate behaviors into seperate interfaces 
- Create classes that implement such behaviors  
- Create an abstract class that references each interface 
- Extend the abstract class with concrete examples 

``` java 

``` 

``` go 


``` 

``` swift 

``` 

``` kotlin 


```
