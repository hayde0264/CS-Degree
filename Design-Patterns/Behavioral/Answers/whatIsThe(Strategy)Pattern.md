# What is the Strategy pattern? 

**Strategy pattern** - is a behavioral design pattern that **creates a group of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable**.

- **Abstract Class with reference to Inteface** 
- **Concrete Classes (that extent the abstract class) and implement Interface algorithms**
- **Interfaces for different concrete classes**
