# Microservices 

Microservices are **an architectural approach to building applications**. 

This **SOA** (Service-Oriented architecture) constructs applications as a collection of **loosely-coupled, fine-grained services** which communicate through lightweight protocols. 

## Microservices: 
- communicate over a network with protocols such as HTTP
- are organized around business capabilities 
- can implement different programming languages, databases, hardware, and software environments 
- focus on small services that are decentralized and built and released with automated processes
