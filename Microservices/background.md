# Microservices 

Microservices are **an architectural approach to building applications**. 

This **SOA** (Service-Oriented architecture) constructs applications as a collection of **loosely-coupled, fine-grained services** which communicate through lightweight protocols. 

## Microserices: 
- communicate over a network with protocols such as HTTP
- are organized around business capibilities 
- can implement different programming languages, databases, hardware and software enviornments 
- focus on small services that are decentralized and built and released with automated processes
