# What are relationships? 

In the *universal-modeling language* there 
are three different kinds of relationships. 
They are: dependencies, generalization, and 
association. 

## Dependencies  
**Dependencies** - are the relationships between two different 
		   entities. An object is considered a depend 
  		   if by changing its implemention another class 
		   would be impacted.

## Generalizations  
**Generalization** - are relationships in which one entity 
		     inherts the properties of another entity. 

## Association 
**Association** - are the "structural" relationships between objects
