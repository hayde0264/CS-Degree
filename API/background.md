# APIs

APIs allow you to communicate with other products or services **without having to know how they're implemented**. 

Different from the user interface, which connects the device to a person, an application programming interface **connects computers or pieces of software together**. 

One purpose of APIs is to **hide the interal details** of how a system works, exposing only part the programmer will find useful. 

## API release policies: 
- **Private**: the API is for internal company use only. 
- **Partner**: only specific business partners can use the API. 
- **Public**: the API is available for use by the public.
