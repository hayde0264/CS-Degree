# APIs

Different from the user interface, which connects the device to a person, an application programming interface **connects computers or pieces of software together**. 

These tools allow clients and servers to **send and receive** data and instructions amongst each other via the web server. 

# APIs ensure: 
- that clients are allowed to make requests to send or receive data 
- that requests from clients are in the correct format before interacting with such request 
- that data returned is in the expected format requested by the client 
- that the client will be acknowledged if no data is returned 

## API release policies: 
- **Private**: the API is for internal company use only. 
- **Partner**: only specific business partners can use the API. 
- **Public**: the API is available for use by the Public.
