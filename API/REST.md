# RESTful APIs

A REST API (or RESTful API) conforms to the constraints of a REST architecture style, which allows interactions between web services. 

# How do they work? 
REST APIs communicate through HTTP requests which perform standard database functions such as **creating, reading, updating, and deleting** records (these are known as CRUD operations). 

RESTful APIs deliver information to requesting clients in various formats, including JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is known to be the **most popular method**. 


# What's the process?
1. A client sends a request to a server (by following API formats that the server understands). 
2. The server authenticates the client and decides if a client has the right to make a request or not 
3. If the client is approved, the server receives the request and starts processing such a request 
4. The server returns a response to the client
