# REST 

A REST API (or RESTful API) conforms to the constraints of a REST architecture style, which allows interactions between web services. 

# How do they work? 
1. A client sends a request ot a server (by following API formats that the server understands). 
2. The server authenticates the client and decides if a client has the right to make a request or not 
3. If client is approved, server recieves request and starts processing such request 
4. The server returns a response to the client
