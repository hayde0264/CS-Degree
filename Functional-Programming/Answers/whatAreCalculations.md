# Calculations 

**Calculations** - are computations from input to output. Calculations, when given the same input, should return the same output. 

Calculations can be called from anywhere and anytime without affecting values outside of their scope. Making them **easy to test and have to use**. 

## Calculations in FP: 
- statically aid correctness  
- provide mathematical tools 
- provide testing strategies
