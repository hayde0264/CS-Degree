# Data 

**Data** - is recorded facts about events. 

Data is interesting because **it is meaningful without being run**. Data can also be interpreted **in multiple ways**. 

For example, a restaurant recipe can be used by the resturant manager to determine popular menu items, and it also can 
be used by the customer to track their dining-out-budget. 

## FP can influence data by: 
- organizing for efficient access 
- creating disciplines to keep records 
- capturing what's important within the data
