# Trees

A tree is an abstract data type that stores elements **hierarchically**. Excluding the top element, each element in 
a tree has a **parent** element and **zero or more children** elements. 

## Hiercarchies 
Hierarchies create relationships among trees. Meaning objects, or more formally, **"nodes," exist **below** or **above** others. So, 
jargon for hierarchies include things such as **"parent," "child," "ancestor," and "descendent"**. 


## Instances: 
- **root nodes** - have **no parents** 
- **internal nodes** - sometimes called **"leaves"** have **one or more** children 
- **external nodes** - have **no children** 
- **sibling nodes** - are nodes that have the **same parent**
