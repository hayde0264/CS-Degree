# What is a binary tree? 

A binary tree is a data structure that is useful for modeling hierarchies. Formally, a binary tree can be empty, or the root node (r) will have a left binary tree and a right binary tee. Subtrees themselves are called **binary trees**. The left binary tree is sometimes referred to as the **left subtree** (according to the root), and the right binary tree is referred to as the **right subtree** 
(according to the root). 

## For instance: 
```java
public static class BinaryTreeNode<T> {
       public T data;
       public BinaryTreeNode<T> left, right;
}       
```
