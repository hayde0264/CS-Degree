# Defining Classes 

When you write software for OS X or iOS, most of your time is spend working with **objects**. 

Objects in Objective-C are **just like objects in other object-oriented programming languages**: they package their data with related behavior. 

An app is built as a large ecosystem of interconnected objects **that communicate with each other to solve specific problems**, such as displaying a visual interface, responding to user input, or storing information. For OS X or iOS development, **you don't need to create objects from scratch to solve every conceivable problem**; instead you have a large library **of exsisting objects** available for your use, provided by Cocoa (for OS X) and Cocoa Touch (for iOS). 

Some of these objects are immediately usuable, *such as basic data types like strings and numbers**, or user interface elements like **buttons** and **table views**. Some are designed for you to **customize and combine the objects provided by underlying frameworks** with your own objects to give your app its unique set of features and funcitonality. 

In object-oriented programming terms, an object **is an instance of a class**. Class contain interfaces **which describe the way you intend the class and its instantiated objects to be used**. This interface includes the **list of messages that the class can receieve**, so you also need to provide the class implementation, **which contains the code to be executed in response to each message**.
