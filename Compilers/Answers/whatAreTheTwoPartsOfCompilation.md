 # What are the two parts of compilation? 
  
 The two parts to compilation are the **analysis** and **synthesis**.
  
 During the **analysis** operations implied by the source program **are determined and sent to a hierarchal structure** called a "tree."
                                                                   
 **Synthesis** constructs the desired target program **from the immediate representation**.
