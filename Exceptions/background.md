# Exceptions 

**Exceptions** - are unwanted or unexpected events 
		 which occur during the execution 
 		 of a program. 
		 
#### Excpetions indicate "something went wrong, now what are we going to do about it so we don't sink ship"

## What is exception handling? 
In programming *exception handling* is
the process of responding to runtme errors
so that the regular flow of the program remains
uninterupted.

## How does exception handling work? 
To prevent systems from crashing, 
exceptions disrupt the normal 
operations of a program. When an
exception in called. Exceptions 
render **solutions to software 
problems**.

### Paradigms:
*try block* - contains the exception statements(s). 

*catch block* - will handle uncertain conditions within 
	        the try block. The try block is **always** 
		followed by a catch block. 
		
*throw keyword* - is a keyword used to transfer code from the try 
	  block to the catch block. 
	  
*throws keyword* - is a keyword used for exception handling **without the try and catch block**

*finally block* - is the block executed after the catch block. 
		  This block is
