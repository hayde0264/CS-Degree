# Relational Databases 

Relational databases **organize data among rows and columns**, which collectively form a table.

Relational database systems implement **SQL-based programming interfaces**.

## Why use Relational Databases: 
- They're **flexible** because you easily create, update, or delete data
- They have **ACID compliance**, which stands for (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) data validity
- They're **easy to use** with knowledge of queries
- Multiple people can **collaborate** through operating on and accessing data simultaneously
- They come with **built-in security** when limiting access to specified users
- They're designed with **normalization**, which is a design that reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity
