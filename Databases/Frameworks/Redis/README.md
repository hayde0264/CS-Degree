# Redis 

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory **data structure store**. 

## Redis can be used as a: 
- **Database** 
- **Cache** 
- **Message broker** 
- **Streaming Engine** 

Redis provides data structures such as **strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, geospatial indexes, and streams**. 

Redis allows you to run **atomic operations** on such data structures such as: **appending to a string, incrementing the value in a hash, pushing an element to a list, computer set intersection, union, and difference, or even getting the members with the highest ranking in a sorted set**. 

For great performance, Redis implements the **in-memory database**
