# Centralized Databases 

Centralized databases are databases that operate **entirely within a single location**, which is the opposite of a traditional database (where data is stored in multiple files).

# Where is it stored? 
The database itself is located at a place called the "centralized database."

## Where is that? 
The centralized databases' location is generally a server, CPU, desktop, or mainframe computer accessed by the users through a **computer network like LAN or WAN**.

# How is it implemented? 
Users can access the database **over a computer network**. However, it is the central computer that runs and maintains the database.

# Advantages: 
- manipulation of data will not affect the core data 
- data consistency is maintained as it manages data in a central repository 
- it provides better data quality, which enables organizations to establish data standards 
- it is less costly because fewer vendors are required to handle the data sets 
- strong data security 

# Disadvantages: 
- the size of the database is large, which increases the response time for fetching data 
- difficult to update 
- if the server fails, entire data will be lost
