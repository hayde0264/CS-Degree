While you can perform various procedures with Database management systems, their core task **is to store, retrieve, and update data**. 

## How are they implemented? 
General-purpose DMBS provide public APIs which connect to database languages such as SQL **to allow applications to interact with and manipulate the database**. 

## Common APIs include: 
- Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) 
- Java Databases Connectivity (JDBC)
