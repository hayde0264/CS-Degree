# Lambdas 

                                 LAMBDAS
Lambda expressions (or functions)
are anonymous functions. Anonymous
functions are functions without a
name or identifier. These functions
can contain a list of formal parameters
and a body.

An arrow (->) is used to seperate the list of
paramters within the expressions body.

Like other types in Java, lambda expressions
ARE ALSO TYPES, and their types are considered
"Functional Interface Types".

## Lambda Syntax
(parameters) -> expression
