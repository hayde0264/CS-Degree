# Declaring Data 

In Java, just like many other programming
languages you have to declare your data before
you use it.

Declaring means telling the compiler the types
of data you will be using (not initializing values).

When declaring a value, all you have to do is
tell the compiler the data type and the name
you'd like to assocaite such type with.
