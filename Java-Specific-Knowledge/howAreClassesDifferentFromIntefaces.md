# How are classes different from interfaces? 

1. In classes, you can initialize variables
   and create objects; in interfaces you can't
   instantiate variables or create objects.
2. Classes contain concrete methods (methods
   that contain implementation), but interfaces
   cannot contain concrete methods.
3. Within classes access specifiers are private,
   protected, and public. In interfaces, only one
   specified is allowed (Public).
