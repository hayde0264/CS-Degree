# What does the "static" keyword mean in Java? 

The *static* keyword signifies that a member variable or 
method can be accsessed, without requiring an initialzation 
of the class it belongs to. 

**A user cannon override static methods in Java** 

## Why not? 
Method overriding is based upon dynamic biniding (at runtime), 
but static methods are statically bindined (at compile time). 

### Remember, static methods ARE NOT associated with instances of classes
