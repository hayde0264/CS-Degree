# Lamba Expressions 

*Lamba Expressions* are anonymous, classless functions. 


A lambda expression is a function that can be **referenced 
and passed around as an object**. 

## Why are lambdas powerful? 
Most Java functions lie within an objects scopre, but lambda
expression **do not** and **can be called from anywhere within 
the program**. 

## What is the sytax of a lambda expression? 
- **Arguements** (which are formal paramters enclosed within parethesis) 
- **Tokens** (which point arguements to the body of the expression) 
- **Body** (which contains expressions and statements) 

### (Arguemnts list) -> { expression(s); } || (Arguements list) -> { statement(s); }
