# Methods 

         METHODS
Methods in Java are similar to
functions and procedures in other
languages.

They can be described as "chunks
of code that can be called on
a particular object".

Methods accept parameters as
arguements, and their behaviors
depend on the object they belong to
and the values of input parameters.

EVERY METHOD in Java is specified in
the body of some class.

## Methods have: 
Signatures - which define the name
             and the and the parameters
             for a method
Body - which defines what the method does.

###  Methods allow programmers to SEND MESSAGES to objects.
