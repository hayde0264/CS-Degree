# Collections 

Collections are data structures
which contain and process sets
of data.

The data stored within a collection
is ENCAPSULATED and the access to
such data is only possible through
methods().

Typical collections are:
------------------------
Lists
Stacks
Queues
Trees

Java provides an interface for some
collections, such as List. For example,
the "ArrayList" and "LinkedList" classes
are implementations of the List interface.

A class or interface whose declaration has
one or more type parameters is called a
"generic class". Generic classes allow a
type to operate on objects of different
types.
