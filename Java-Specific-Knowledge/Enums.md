# Enums 

Java supports enumerated typed called enums.

Enums are types that are only allowed to
take on values that come from a specified
set of names.

Once defined, you can use an enum type
to define other variables, similar to
classes.

Enums also have a few built-in methods,
including a method valueOf, which will
return the enum value that is the same
as a given string.
