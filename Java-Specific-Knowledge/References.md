# References 

In Java, you treat everything as an object.

Although you treat everything as an object,
the identifier you manipulate is actually
a "reference to the object"

You can image a tv (the object) and the
remote control (the reference). As long
as you're holding the remote, you have
a connection to the television, but when
someone says "change the channel" or "lower
the volume," what your're manipulating is
the REFERENCE, which modifies the OBJECT.

If you want to move around the room and
still control the television, you can take
the remote/reference with you, but not the
television.
