# Package

A package is a "namespace" that organizes
a set of related classes and interfaces.

You can think of a package like the different
folders on your computer. You may keep HTML
pages in one folder, images in another, and
scripts or applictions in yet another.

Because software written in Java can be composed
of hundreds or thousands of indivitual classes, it
makes sense to keep things organized by placing
related classes and interfaces into packages.
