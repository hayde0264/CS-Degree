# HTTP 

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) allows communication between web browsers and web servers, among other purposes. 

HTTP works on within a client-server paradigm. 

## How do clients and servers communicate? 
Clients and servers communicate by exchanging **messages**. 

Messages are sent by the client, these are called **requests**. 

Messages send by the server, in response to the clients, are called **responses**.
