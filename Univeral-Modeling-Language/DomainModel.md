# Domain Models 

Domain models are representable for the **identification of classes, their attributes, and associations among other concepts within the system**.

>"Note domain models are not descriptions of software objects; but rather a visual representation of concepts or models of a real-world domain. So
sometimes domains are considered **conceptual object models**."
