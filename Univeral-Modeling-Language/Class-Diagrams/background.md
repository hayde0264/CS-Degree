# Class Diagrams 

**Class diagrams** - describe the types of objects that exsist within a system, and the various relationships among classes. 

Class diagrams also show **the properties and operations** in classes identified constraints which refers to the ability of other objects in the system to access them. d


# Properties 
Are **represental features of a class**. They can be broken down into two categories: **attributes and associations**. 

**attributes** - describes properties as a **line of text within the class itself** 
**associations** - are values that **hold associations between classes**. 

The **multiplicity** of a property **indicates how many objects may fille the property**. 

## UML syntax for properties include: 


Multiplicities can be defines as: 
- **optional**, which implies a lower bound of 0 
- **mandatory**, which impllies a lower boud of 1 or possibly more 
- **single-valued**, which implieas an upper bound of 1 
- **multivalued**, which implies an upper bound of more than 1 

## Operations 
Operations are **actions the class may carry out**.
