# Secure Sockets Layer

A secure socket layer, or <code>SSL</code>, is an encryption-based internet security tool. Websites that use **"https"** in their URL, not **"http"** are implementing this method. 

## How does it work? 
Secure socket layers encrypt data transmitted among devices. Or in lamens terms, this means 
that anyone trying to intercept such data will only see a jumbled mix of characters that is nearly 
impossible to decrypt. 

SSL ensures that communicating devices are who they claim to be when making a **"handshake"**. 


## How is SSL different from TLS? 
SSL is the predecessor of another protocol called the **Transport Layer Security** (TLS). However, since 
the two are so closely related some people refer to SSL when mentioning TLS. 

## What are SSL certificates? 
SSL certificates are similar to an ID card in the fact they then prove someone is who they say they are. These certificates 
are stored and displayed on the Web by a website or an applications server.
