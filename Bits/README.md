# Bits 

<code>Bits</code> - are the most basic units of information computers process. Bits are represented as either "1" or "0," which can be interpreted as true (1) or false (0). Bits are stored in memory with capacitors whose responsibility is to determine the electrical charge. Within the hardware layer, the charge determines the state of each bit 
1 or 0.

## What is a byte?
Since bits are so small, you don't work with single bits but rather with a string of bits, sometimes called a "byte." Bytes, which are composed of eight bits, contain enough information to store ASCII characters (ASCII enables electronic communication).

## How many bytes are in a: 
- **Kilobyte (KB)** - one thousand bytes 
- **Megabyte (MB)** - one million bytes 
- **Gigabyte (GB)** - one billion bytes 
- **Terabyte (TB)** - one trillion bytes
