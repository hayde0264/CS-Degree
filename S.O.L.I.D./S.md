# Single-Responsibility 

Says, *"a class should be responsible for one thing"*. 

## What does that mean?
That the name of a class should 
explain its functions **with as little 
vagueness as possible**. 

If the name of a class is too long 
or too vague, **split the class into 
multiple classes**.
