 # What are the uses of Annotations?


 ## Annotations can:
 - **Inform the compiler** - of errors or to suppress warnings
 - **Aid compile and deployment processing** - through software tools that can process annotated information to generate code, XML files, etc.
 - **Control runtime processing** - since some annotations are available and intended to be examined at runtime.
