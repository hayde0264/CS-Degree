# What is behavior parameterization? 

**Behavior parameterization** - references the ability of a method that takes multiple behaviors parameters to internally provide 
different behaviors. Behavior parameterization, when appropriately used, **creates code that is adaptive to change, which saves engineering efforts
in the **future**.  

When creating code that can adapt to different behaviors, **avoid anonymous classes (which are verbose)** instead opt for **lambdas**.
