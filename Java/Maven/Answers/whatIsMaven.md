# What is Maven? 

Maven, which is Yiddish for **"accumulator of knowledge**, is a tool that is used for **building and managing** Java projects. 



## Objectives include: 
- **simplifying the build process** 
- **creating a uniform build system** 
- **providing quality project information** 
- **implementing better development methods** 

## What is the uniform build system? 
Within Maven projects, the **project object model (POM)** is the center director of a project. 

Within the POM maven provides: **a change log directly from source control, references sources, lists managed by the project, dependencies, 
and unit test reports that include coverage**.
