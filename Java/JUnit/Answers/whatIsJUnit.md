# JUnit


JUnit is a software system used for testing Java code.

## Highlights
JUnit provides a lightweight and simple interface for creating **unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and even user
interface tests**.

JUnit will automatically stop builds and **flag errors** if a test fails.


## Convenvince

Luckily for Java developers, JUnit is included in most build tools such as **Ant, Maven, Gradle, and SBT**.
