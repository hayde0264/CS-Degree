# How do you create a simple server? 

# Steps 
- create application on local computer 
- create controller that responds to web requests 
- test on localhost:8080 

## 1 - Creating Application 
For this step, you have two options, the first: using the **Micronaut Command Line Interface** (which I used) or with **Microlaunch** (which is similar to Springs initializer).
