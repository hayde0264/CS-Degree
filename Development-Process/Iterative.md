# Iterative Processes 

Break down projects into **subsets of functionality**. 

It the first iteartion, you'd take a **quarter of the requirements** and complete the software cycle for that quarter. At the end of the first iteration, **you'd have a system that does a quarter of the needed functinlaity**. Next, you'd do a second iteartion so that at the end of 6 months, **you'd have a system that does half the functionality**. 

It can be common for iteration's code to become very buggy, but within this process **that's okay**, it will be "cleaned up" at the end.
