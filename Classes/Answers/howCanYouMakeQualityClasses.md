# Quality Checklist 

## Abstract Data Types 
- Have you considered the classes in your program as abstract data types? If so, have you evaluated their interfaces from that point of view? 

## Abstraction 
- Does the class have a central purpose? 
- Is the class named well, and does its name describe its central purpose? 
- Does the class's interface present abstraction? 
- Does the class's interface make it easy for objects to instantiate?
